  "summary": "Donald Trump's second term is facing significant challenges, with open dissent from senior Republicans and growing anger among core MAGA voters. The president's economic message is being openly challenged by voters he once counted on, and his administration's response to the fatal shooting of an ICU nurse by immigration agents has triggered outrage across the political spectrum. The coalition that once looked unbreakable is starting to fray, with Trump's authority, credibility, and grip on power being questioned. The fallout from militarised immigration enforcement, an embarrassing climbdown over Greenland, and growing anger over the cost of living are all taking their toll. Trump's presidency is increasingly being seen as divisive and damaging, with his rhetoric and policies sparking widespread criticism. As the midterm elections loom, Trump's ability to maintain his base and appeal to a broader audience will be crucial to his success.",
