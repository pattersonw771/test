  "summary": "Vice President JD Vance has been criticized by the National Catholic Reporter for his response to the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. The newspaper's digital editor, John Grosso, accused Vance of choosing 'MAGA over Jesus' and promoting a message of division and blame. Vance, a Catholic convert, had the opportunity to call for peace and unity but instead offered a politicizing response. Grosso's opinion piece argues that Vance's comments are a moral stain on the collective witness of Catholicism. The criticism is not surprising, given Vance's history of controversial statements. Vance's response has been condemned by many, with some arguing that his Catholicism is being used as a political prop.",

  "essay": "The opinion piece published by the National Catholic Reporter is a scathing critique of Vice President JD Vance's response to the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. The author, John Grosso, argues that Vance's comments are not only divisive but also a moral stain on the collective witness of Catholicism. Vance's decision to promote a message of blame and division rather than peace and unity is seen as a failure of his Catholic values. The criticism is not limited to this incident, as Vance has a history of making controversial statements that have been condemned by many. The use of Catholicism as a political prop is a concerning trend, and one that undermines the values of the faith. Furthermore, the fact that Vance's comments have been widely criticized suggests that his message is not resonating with many Americans. Overall, the opinion piece is a powerful critique of Vance's actions and a call to action for people of faith to stand up against divisive rhetoric."
