  "summary": "Democrats are seeking a war powers resolution vote on Greenland, citing concerns that President Trump may attempt to seize the territory through military action. This move comes after two Senate Republicans flipped their votes on a war powers resolution for Venezuela, leading Democrats to question whether Republicans will stand up to the president. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., expressed disappointment that a war powers resolution for Venezuela was not passed, and now Democrats want Republicans to take action on Greenland. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is pushing for a war powers resolution to limit Trump's ability to take Greenland, and expects strong Republican support. However, many Democrats are skeptical that Republicans will actually stand up to Trump, given their past behavior. The issue has sparked debate among lawmakers, with some Republicans expressing discomfort with Trump's comments on Greenland. Despite this, it remains to be seen whether Congress can come together to pass a war powers resolution. Democrats are pushing for action, but it's unclear whether they can overcome Republican opposition. The situation is complex, with multiple factors at play, and it's difficult to predict the outcome.",
