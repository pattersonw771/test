  "essay": "The Trump administration's plan to renovate the White House ballroom has sparked controversy, with the National Trust for Historic Preservation suing to stop the project. The administration's argument that the president has the legal authority to undertake the project and fund it with private donations has been met with skepticism by a federal judge. The judge pressed an administration lawyer on the issues, describing the plan to fund the project with private gifts as a 'Rube Goldberg contraption'. The case presents a series of complicated legal issues, with the judge focusing on two federal statutes. The judge signaled that he will likely not issue a decision this month, but 'hopefully' in February. The White House has said the project will be funded by private donations, but the National Trust is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the project until the federal review process is complete. The size and cost of the project have increased since first being unveiled, with Trump saying the project would cost $400 million, after an initial estimate of $200 million. The judge noted that Republicans control both houses of Congress, and that the president could have gone to lawmakers to seek approval for the demolition and rebuild. He also suggested the $2.5 million Congress recently appropriated for White House maintenance was for 'very small-size projects', not a ballroom. The case has raised questions over congressional oversight and the president's authority to undertake the project. The outcome of the case is uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for the Trump administration's plans for the White House."
