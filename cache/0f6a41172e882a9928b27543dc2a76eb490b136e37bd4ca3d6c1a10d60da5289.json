The website singles out a handful of Democrat governors labeled 'failures' for resisting the new program. President Trump is pushing states to 'opt in' to a new federal K-12 scholarship tax credit created under the 'big, beautiful bill.' The Department of Education celebrated Monday that 23 states have so far opted in to a program the department called the 'largest national expansion of education freedom in history.' The White House is encouraging Americans to call their governors if they have not yet opted into the federal school choice tax credit. This move has been seen as an attempt to pressure governors into opting into the program. The website also lists a handful of Democratic state leaders branded with the label 'failures' for resisting the new program. The White House's move has been met with criticism from some who see it as an overreach of executive power. Others have praised the move as a necessary step to increase education freedom. The debate surrounding the federal school choice tax credit continues to be a contentious issue in American politics. As the 2027 deadline approaches, it remains to be seen how many states will opt into the program. The White House's efforts to encourage governors to opt in will likely continue to be a major point of contention in the coming months."
