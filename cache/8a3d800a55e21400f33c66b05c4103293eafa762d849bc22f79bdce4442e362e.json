  "summary": "A federal judge has expressed skepticism over the Trump administration's plan to renovate the White House East Wing, citing concerns over the president's authority to undertake the project and fund it with private donations. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to stop the project, arguing that it requires congressional approval and public comment. The judge, Richard Leon, questioned the administration's lawyer over the legality of the project, comparing the plan to a 'Rube Goldberg contraption' that would evade congressional oversight. The administration argues that the president has the authority to make changes to the White House, but the judge remains unconvinced. The case presents a series of complicated legal issues, including the question of whether the president can use private donations to fund the project. The judge has not yet made a decision, but is expected to rule in February. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the future of the White House and the role of the president in making changes to the historic building.",
