  "summary": "Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, a 16-year-old Chicago teenager, has died after a battle with cancer. She had gained national attention for fighting for her father's release from ICE detention. Torres Hidalgo's father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained in October 2025 during the Trump administration's 'Operation Midway Blitz' immigration enforcement campaign. Following her father's arrest, Torres Hidalgo posted a video on social media calling for his release, describing him as a hardworking immigrant who cared for her younger brother while she was in the hospital for treatment.

Torres Hidalgo was present via Zoom at her father's hearing and was hailed as heroic and brave in the face of ICE's detention and threatened deportation of her father.",
