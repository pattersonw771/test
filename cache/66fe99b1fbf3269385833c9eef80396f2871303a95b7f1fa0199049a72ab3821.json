  "summary": "President Donald Trump has warned that he no longer feels obligated to think 'purely of peace' as he argued the United States must have 'complete and total control' of Greenland. Trump made the statement in a text exchange with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, citing the country's decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize. The president has proposed tariff increases on several countries, including Denmark, Norway, and Finland, in an effort to pressure them into selling Greenland to the US. The move has been met with opposition from European leaders, who have called for de-escalation measures. Trump has pointed to Greenland's strategic importance, citing its location between North America and Europe as critical to US missile defense and Arctic surveillance. The situation has sparked a debate over the use of force to acquire the island, with Trump and his advisors arguing that it is necessary for national security. The European Union has debated retaliatory tariffs against the US, but diplomats have insisted on seeking de-escalation measures first. The situation remains tense, with no clear resolution in sight. Trump's actions have been seen as a departure from his previous stance on peace, and have raised concerns about the implications for global security.",
  "essay": "The situation surrounding Greenland has sparked a heated debate over national security and global politics. President Trump's proposal to acquire the island has been met with opposition from European leaders, who argue that it is a sovereign territory of Denmark. The use of tariff increases as a means of pressure has been seen as a aggressive move, and has raised concerns about the implications for global trade. The European Union has debated retaliatory tariffs against the US, but diplomats have insisted on seeking de-escalation measures first. The situation remains tense, with no clear resolution in sight. Trump's actions have been seen as a departure from his previous stance on peace, and have raised concerns about the implications for global security. The acquisition of Greenland would give the US a strategic advantage in the Arctic region, but it would also raise questions about the treatment of the island's indigenous population. The situation is complex, and requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the interests of all parties involved. The US and European leaders must work together to find a solution that balances national security concerns with the need to respect the sovereignty of other nations. The use of force to acquire the island is not a viable option, and would only serve to escalate the situation. Instead, the US and European leaders must engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The situation in Greenland is a test of global leadership, and requires a thoughtful and considered approach to resolve the crisis. The world is watching, and the outcome will have far-reaching implications for global security and stability.",
